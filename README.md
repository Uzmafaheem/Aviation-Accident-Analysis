# Aviation Accident Analysis

This project analyzes aviation accident data to provide insights into aircraft safety, accident causes, and injury severity. The dataset was cleaned, filtered, and transformed to focus on modern, professional airplane accidents and to construct measurable safety metrics.

The clientâ€™s focus was on:

Airplanes only (excluding helicopters, balloons, ultralights).

Professional builds (excluding amateur-built aircraft).

Events within the last 40 years for modern relevance.

Injury & Damage Metrics to quantify accident severity and robustness to destruction.
